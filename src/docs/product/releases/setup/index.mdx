Setting up releases fully is a multi-step process, and is adaptable to your organization's needs.

## Basic

1. [Configure Your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/)
2. [Notify Sentry when you deploy a release](/product/releases/notify-sentry/)

## Enable Suspect Commits

With an additional [repository integration](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) or [manual commits](/product/releases/setup/manual-setup-releases/), you can also track suspect commits.

1. [Install a repository integration](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) (this step is optional, but highly recommended)
2. [Associate commits to a release](/product/releases/suspect-commits/) by adding to your release management script when you build a release

## Enable Release Health Tracking

With your [SDK configured](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/) for session tracking, you can monitor [Release Health](/product/releases/health/).
